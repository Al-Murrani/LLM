sentence splitting - where sentence begin and end
co-reference resolution - when a token refers to other token or set of tokens in the same sentence or another
tokenizing spacy.nlp
PoS tagging such as noun, verb
constituency parsing
dependency parsing


Here's an overview of all the new skills you learned so far:

chapter 1, you learned how to extract linguistic features like part-of-speech tags, syntactic dependencies and named entities, and how to work with trained pipelines.

You also learned to write powerful match patterns to extract words and phrases using spaCy's matcher and phrase matcher.

Chapter 2 was all about information extraction, and you learned how to work with the data structures, the Doc, Token and Span, as well as the Vocab and lexical entries.

You also used spaCy to predict semantic similarities using word vectors.

In chapter 3, you got some more insights into spaCy's pipeline, and learned to write your own custom pipeline components that modify the doc.

You also created your own custom extension attributes for docs, tokens and spans, and learned about processing streams and making your pipeline faster.

Finally, in chapter 4, you learned about training and updating spaCy's statistical models, specifically the entity recognizer.

You learned some useful tricks for how to create training data, and how to design your label scheme to get the best results.
